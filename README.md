# Linear Regression Prediction: MobileApp or Website sales?
The project aims to predict whether an e-commerce company should go for website sales or a mobile app using the available customer datasets

# Tools Used:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn

# Plots:
The Analysys results can be visualized using the Plots: 

Description of the Plots are given below
* Figure 1: jointplot to compare 'Time on Website' and 'Yearly Amount Spent' variables
* Figure 2: jointplot to compare 'Time on App' and 'Yearly Amount Spent' variables
* Figure 3: jointplot to compare 'Time on App' and 'Length of Membership' variables
* Figure 4: pairplot to compare our datasets
* Figure 5: linear model plot of 'Yearly Amount Spent' vs 'Length of Membership'
* Figure 6: scatterplot of the real test value and the predicted value
* Figure 7: histogram of the residuals to check if it looks normally distributed
