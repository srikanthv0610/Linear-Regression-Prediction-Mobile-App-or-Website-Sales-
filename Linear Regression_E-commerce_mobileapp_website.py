### Linear Regression Model
# Objective: Predict whether an e-commerce company should go for mobile app or website sales using Linear Regression Technique  

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

customers = pd.read_csv("Ecommerce Customers")


print(customers.head())

print(customers.describe())

print(customers.info())

#Use seaborn to create a jointplot to compare the different variables with Yearly Amount Spent columns.

#Important to Note: More time on site, more money spent.

sns.jointplot(x='Time on Website',y='Yearly Amount Spent',data=customers)

sns.jointplot(x='Time on App',y='Yearly Amount Spent',data=customers)

sns.jointplot(x='Time on App',y='Length of Membership',kind='hex',data=customers)

#Using pairplot to compare our datasets:

sns.pairplot(customers)

#Create a linear model plot (using seaborn's lmplot) of Yearly Amount Spent vs. Length of Membership.
sns.lmplot(x='Length of Membership',y='Yearly Amount Spent',data=customers)

### Training and Testing Data
#Training and Testing set split:
#Set X (independent variable matrix) equal to the numerical features of the customers,
#Set y (dependent variable) equal to the "Yearly Amount Spent" column.

y = customers['Yearly Amount Spent']
X = customers[['Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App','Time on Website', 'Length of Membership']]


#Use model_selection.train_test_split from sklearn to split the data into
#training and testing sets. Set test_size=0.3

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=40)

#Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

lm = LinearRegression()

#Train/fit lm on the training data.
lm.fit(X_train,y_train)
LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=1, normalize=False)

#Print out the Coefficients of the model
print('Coefficients: \n', lm.coef_)
#Coefficients:
# [ 25.287716  39.171783   
#    0.321668  61.248401]

#Predicting Test Data:
predictions = lm.predict(X_test)

#Create a scatterplot of the real test values versus the predicted values.
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(y_test,predictions)
plt.xlabel('Y Test')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Y')

### Evaluating the Model

#Evaluate our model performance by calculating the residual sum of squares and the explained variance score (R^2).
#Calculate the Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and the Root Mean Squared Error.

# calculate the quality metrics
from sklearn import metrics

print('MAE:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
print('MSE:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('RMSE:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))

#>> Result:
#MAE: 8.414860085645259
#MSE: 109.27910351983392
#RMSE: 10.45366459763436

#Residuals

#Plot a histogram of the residuals and check if it looks normally distributed.
plt.figure()
sns.distplot((y_test-predictions),bins=50)
plt.show()

#Conclusion

#Do we focus our efforst on mobile app or website development?
#Or maybe that doesn't even really matter, and Membership Time is what is really important. Let's see if we can interpret the coefficients at all to get an idea.

#Recreate the dataframe below.

coeffecients = pd.DataFrame(lm.coef_,X.columns)
coeffecients.columns = ['Coeffecient']
print(coeffecients)

#                      Coeffecient
#Avg. Session Length     25.287716
#Time on App             39.171783
#Time on Website          0.321668
#Length of Membership    61.248401

#How can you interpret these coefficients?

#Interpreting the coefficients:

# 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of 25.28 total euros spent, keeping all other features fixed.
# 1 unit increase in Time on App is associated with an increase of 39.17 total euros spent, keeping all other features fixed.
# 1 unit increase in Time on Website is associated with an increase of 0.32 total euros spent, keeping all other features fixed.
# 1 unit increase in Length of Membership is associated with an increase of 61.25 total euros spent, keeping all other features fixed.
